## About ##
The Domestic Security System takes advantage of all the diverse features that this robot has. Using the myro robot, we aim to build a domestic security management tool. While the owners of the home are asleep, the always-on robot can sense change in the lighting of the room. A timer will then be activated, if it is not turned off by entering in a pre-set security code, the robot will start beeping and take pictures.
